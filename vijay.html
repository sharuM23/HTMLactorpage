  The Mitsubishi Pajero (三菱・パジェロ; Japanese: [pad͡ʑeɾo]; English: /pəˈhɛroʊ/; Spanish: [paˈxeɾo])[6][7] is a full-size SUV (sport utility vehicle) manufactured and marketed globally by Mitsubishi over four generations—introduced in 1981 and discontinued in 2021.[1][2]

The Pajero nameplate derives from Leopardus pajeros, the Pampas cat.[8] Mitsubishi marketed the SUV as the Montero in North America, Spain, and Latin America (except for Brazil and Jamaica) due to the term "pajero" being derogatory (meaning "wanker") in Spanish. In the United Kingdom, it was known as the Shogun, named after the Japanese word for "General." The model was discontinued in North America in 2006.[9]
